# ðŸš€ freeCodeCamp Front-End Roadmap Projects

This repository contains the official projects included in the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Front-End Development roadmap.

All projects are built strictly following the challenges and requirements defined in the curriculum.  
They focus on hands-on practice with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, often with specific constraints (e.g., no CSS or JS in beginner projects).
