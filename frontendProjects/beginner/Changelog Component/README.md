# [Changelog Component](https://roadmap.sh/projects/changelog-component)

This is a beginner-level front-end project for freeCodeCamp.  
It uses semantic HTML and CSS (no JS).

The goal of this project is was to teach me about positioning and layout in CSS.  
I created a simple HTML structure and used CSS to style it into a visually appealing and responsive changelog component.  

## ðŸ“¥ How to Run
Open `index.html` directly in a browser.
