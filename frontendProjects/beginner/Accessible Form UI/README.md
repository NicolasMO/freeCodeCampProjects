# [Accessible Form UI](https://roadmap.sh/projects/accessible-form-ui)

This is a beginner-level front-end project for freeCodeCamp.  
It uses semantic HTML and CSS (no JS).

The goal of this project was to practice HTML and CSS with focus on creating an accessible form that is easy to use for all users, including those with disabilities.  
I created a HTML structure and used CSS to style it into a visually appealing and responsive accessible form.  
While this version of the form wonâ€™t be functional, it will be a static UI component that can be enhanced with JavaScript in the future.
