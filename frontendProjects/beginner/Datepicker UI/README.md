# [Datepicker UI](https://roadmap.sh/projects/datepicker-ui)

This is a beginner-level front-end project for freeCodeCamp.  
It uses semantic HTML and CSS (no JS).

The goal of this project was to test my knowledge about positioning layout and styling techniques in CSS, this is not a functional version. 
I created a HTML structure and used CSS to style it into a visually appealing Datepicker.  

## ðŸ“¥ How to Run
Open `index.html` directly in a browser.
